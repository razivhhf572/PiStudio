# Development & Packaging

This guide covers building PiStudio from source and creating distribution packages.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/ayuayue/PiStudio.git
cd PiStudio

# Install
npm install

# Start dev mode
npm run dev
```

The dev mode launches the Electron app with Vite hot-reload. Changes to the renderer, main, or preload processes are reflected immediately.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development mode |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build |
| `npm run dist` | Build and package for current platform |
| `npm run dist:win` | Package for Windows |
| `npm run dist:mac` | Package for macOS |
| `npm run dist:linux` | Package for Linux |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| `npm run docs:dev` | Start docs site dev server |

## Packaging

PiStudio uses `electron-builder` for packaging. The build configuration is in `package.json` under the `"build"` key.

### Platform-Specific Notes

**Windows:**
- Requires NSIS for the .exe installer
- Windows 10+ recommended
- Code signing optional but recommended for distribution

**macOS:**
- Requires a Mac for building .dmg packages
- Apple Silicon (arm64) and Intel (x64) builds supported
- Notarization recommended for distribution

**Linux:**
- AppImage and deb targets supported
- FUSE required for AppImage
- Tested on Ubuntu 22.04+

### Output

Packaged files are written to the `release/` directory. The output includes:

- Installer (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, or `.deb`)
- Portable/manual-download archives where applicable (`.zip`)
- Platform update metadata and blockmaps for updater-supported targets

## Application Update Releases

Application update checks always run in the background. `autoDownloadUpdates` is the only app-update preference and defaults to enabled; installation is never automatic. After a download completes, the user explicitly chooses **Restart and install** in Settings. Pi CLI version checks remain independent of the desktop-app updater.

- **Windows** uses `electron-updater` with the NSIS installer. Upload `latest.yml`, the NSIS `*-setup.exe` named by that manifest, and its matching `*.blockmap` to the same GitHub Release. The portable executable and ZIP are manual-download assets only.
- **Linux** uses its platform channel metadata (normally `latest-linux.yml`) together with the artifact and blockmap named by that manifest. Keep those files in the same GitHub Release.
- **macOS** currently checks the latest GitHub Release and opens it for manual installation. Without a Developer ID signature and notarization, PiStudio does not attempt silent replacement or claim a Gatekeeper-safe automatic update path. Upload the DMG/ZIP release assets for both architectures as applicable.

Run `npm run dist:win` for the Windows release set. Its final output lists only current-version assets and warns when the NSIS updater trio is incomplete.
